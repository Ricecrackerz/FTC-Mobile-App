### What is Fall Training Conference?
"The Fall Training Conference Committee plans and coordinates the Districtâ€™s first large scale district-wide event of the year. Fall Training Conference is a three-day, two-night event held at Old Oak Ranch in which members of the CNH District come together to learn more about Circle K International, meet members from around the district, and develop as members and leaders within Circle K International. New and returning members alike have the opportunity to really see the impact our clubs make in this organization while also creating lifelong memories with one another. We hope you will join us in the mountains of Sonora, CA from November 1-3, 2019, as we immerse ourselves in the MYSTERY of a lifetime and celebrate the start of a new term!"

### About the App
This app helps the event creators and participants stay connected all in one place. The app provides a hub to see recent announcements and shoutouts, updated schedules, reources (documentation), and to send responses to workshop hosts. The app also has a secret admin area for event hosts to send announcements and shoutouts. The app utilizes Google's Firebase to send and recieve announcements, shoutouts, and responses from both the participants and event hosts.
